# TechSync
5th Semester Project
The Sync is an application which completely handles the registration process of the Fest. When the participants do on the spot registration, thereâ€™s no technology present which can smoothen the process and this causes ambiguity and communication gap between the registration desk and events coordinators.
Individuals can register on the platform to access the full features of the software. Upon registration they're redirected to an events page which informs users of various activities proposed. Individuals can register for each event and submit data forms that are securely transferred to the main database.
This project handles the complete registration process of the fest. It also aids everyone as this has centralised database which allows transparency, smooth functioning, and fast registration.
