# TechSync
TechSync is a programme that takes care of the entire Fest registration process. When attendees register on the spot, there is no technology available to streamline the process, resulting in ambiguity and a communication gap between the registration desk and event coordinators.
Individuals can sign up for a free account on the platform to gain access to all of the software's capabilities. They are sent to an events page after registering, which informs users of the numerous activities available. Individuals can sign up for each event and fill out data forms that are securely transmitted to the main database.
This project is in charge of the event's entire registration procedure. It also benefits everyone because it has a central database that provides for transparency, seamless operation, and quick registration.
